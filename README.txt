Mach is intended to be a highly optimized machine learning library written in and for C++ applications in linux.

The current goal is to build a linear algebra library as the foundation. It will begin as a naive serial implementation and branch down two paths as it evolves. Path 1 will be a highly optimized serial implementation with multithreading and possible OpenMPI and OpenCL additions. Path 2 will receive more attention and will be implemented with CUDA.

For now, I intend for the majority of my work to be licensed under the GPL, but this may change once parallel implementations begin.

I have experience implementing programs to solve linear regression and logistic regression problems including those requiring a neural network, but I have done so primarily in MATLAB and Python. I also have experience with multithreading in linux and (less) experience with CUDA and OpenMPI and parallel algorithms. As a result, I have the skillset to take on this project, but it may be slow as I reach points where more research is necessary as well as when work picks up (I'm a full-time project engineer).
